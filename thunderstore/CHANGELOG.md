**1.1.0** : 
```
Revamp of spawn effects.  These effects will queue until they can be spawned! (In the facility or outside) If they can't they will be automagically refunded.
 - Rename of spawn effects to match public names
 - Limit the number of spawns that can happen at once
 - Enemies that normally spawn in the facility will only spawn in the facility when using Crowd Control and vice versa for outside enemies
 - Spawning dead bodies should be more stable when spammed (even tho spamming 30+ at once will lag the game hard, it will eventually recover)
 Fixed a bug found in testing that allows users to receive more items then they can carry, which will bug out the player and prevent them from interacting with anything else in game!
